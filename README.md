# LARK
This is a very short text game. But it has 14 endings. For LEARN Academy Delta Cohort 2020.

Download the repo and $ ruby LARK.rb in your terminal to play. You'll want to go full screen as there's big ol' ascii art to be found.

We're shockingly close to our internship interviews and then the end of our time with LEARN Academy.

We made this so that we can all remember what a special, goofy, stressful, amazing time this was.

Hope everyone enjoys it. (Even if you're not one of us. It's fine, we like new friends.)

Love you all.

***DISCLAIMER***


Successful completion of this game will require an encyclopedic knowledge of obscure inside jokes.

There is absolutely no way you will find all 14 endings without looking at the code.

Or a walkthrough.

Oh.

I can help you with that.

You can find many people by brute forcing the decision trees.

However, you don't have to just take the choices given to you. Try the following words in different places:

water
flies
pumpkin pie
ghost dog
jedi
